title: 'Operational Analytics'
content: 'Software driven businesses are run by myriad of technology stacks hosted on disparate IT environments. Detecting the anomalies in a convoluted IT environment fuels more complexity, delays and down-time. This trend will inevitably get worse if companies tackle this problem with mere human intelligence. To counter this downward spiral, to improve the IT-operational excellence & to keep the uptime of day-to-day business operations, companies need intelligent service monitoring & management capabilities. Applying big-data analytics inward for operational systems will enable predictability & stability for companies to run complex business operations.'
