title: 'Interaction Design'
content: 'Interaction design principles underpin the behavior & utility aspects of customer-centric product development process. To gain context to design decisions, our product-design approach starts with a customer dialogue followed by discussions to study workflow, user interactions, user orientation, understanding decision points & mapping the feedback loops. We value humility, learning, listening & curiosity as fundamental guiding principles for a good designer. The design-thinking is a cultural challenge every organization should start adopting to remain valuable to their customers.'
