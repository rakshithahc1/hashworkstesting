       content: 'To compete with speed & agility, companies can no longer afford to run multi-year program for system implementations. There is a paradigm shift in building software from monolith to a world of nimble, faster, modular, reusable & contextual application architectures sourced for internal & external use. Applications are not built to maintain for a specific purpose anymore, future of applications is modular & convene with modern integration techniques and a cloud-first, mobile-first approach. Fluid architecture enable the IT-systems to evolve & deliver simultaneously with the continuous business change & market demand.'}

   	   title: 'Data Plumbing',
       content: 'Businesses today are no longer posed with lack of enough data, they are challenged to analyze the right data to gain meaningful insights about their current & future trends. So the goal is to repurpose the data as a strategic input for determining business gaps and customer needs. Plumbing the data gaps requires fundamental shift in the design philosophy of building applications & roadmap planning. Applications should not only be built to fulfil the business functions but also gather right insight to help companies achieve their business goals. It has to start with the design of right feedback loop for gathering insight by setting goals, creating questionnaire that impact your operations or business outcomes. Data is a strategic asset, data driven decision making enables companies to be more productive & actionable. It enables companies to find solution for a problem in a different way. Creating a fluid architecture with right API strategy will help business to build intelligent recommendation engines that answers their customer & market needs.'}

       content: 'Software development is a discovery process, it is more adaptive in nature and not prescriptive. It is all about shorter, time boxed & automated approach to deliver a tangible piece of shippable work at the end of each iteration. Focus is not on writing perfect requirement document & a clean code but more about writing contextual code for tangible user stories that deliver business value. Agile & DevOps underpin the productivity of software development process. Agile focus on project management & delivery practices while DevOps improves the velocity of delivery & test cycles, enable faster feedback cycles, implement service virtualization, automation, refactoring practices and enable auto-orchestration of release pipeline. Leading the cultural shifts of the organization is the most important aspect before embarking the team for continuous improvement journey. These principles apply at large simply to improve software productivity with set objectives.'}

   	   title: 'Flow Thinking',
       content: 'Flow-based product development approach by Don Reinersten is a rational view to software development process. It debunks the myth of current orthodoxy. The core paradigm of this model is to build, test & release software in small batch transfers, enable quick feedback cycles & limited work-in-process inventory. Flow thinking emphasis product development teams to focus on managing queues not timelines, cost of delay, reduced batch size of work inventory, acceptance to variability in response to cost-to-benefit ratio, time-based cadence and de-centralized control. This approach helps the development teams to increase the throughput, handle requirement variability effectively understand cost-of-delay and improve everyday decision making.'}

       imagesrc: '/assets/img/homepage/it-services.jpg',
       content: 'OODA refers to Observe-Orient-Decide-Act decision cycle, initially developed for war-combat operations by military strategist John Boyd during world war II. This principle was later widely adopted by business operations and took momentum in the software industry through lean-startup principles of Build-Measure-Learn. According to John Boyd, all decisions are based on observations and unfolding of the change for a given problem in context. OODA loops are widely practiced in the software delivery process to respond to variability & adoption of a shippable product with the ability to respond to change quickly.'}

   	   title: 'Design Thinking',
       content: 'There is a huge shift in the way large organization put Design in the center of their thinking. Design has become a catalyst for change, capable of transforming the way companies do business, differentiating themselves from competition, to deliver value, simplify and ultimately selling an experience to a customer. Design, Business & Technology functions are coming together to apply the principles of design to the way people work. There is a culture of human empathy, prototyping & resilience to failure adopted by organizations today to build their products & services to observe behaviour''s and draw conclusions about what people want and need. This approach enables teams to learn what to build in the process of doing it by iterating & pivoting, ultimately building a product that has an emotional connect with its customers.'}
