It might also occur when the future changes defy the current architecture of an IT system. Technical debts cannot be avoided in the software projects but can be mitigated'}

There is a clear demand for the organizations to upgrade their existing workforce and also engage strategic partners that specialize in new technologies to deliver value to their customers without losing the competitive advantage. A bi-nodal approach should be viewed by the large organizations to keep their growth trajectory in balance to upskilling & operational efficiency.

Elastic workforce is the new future for counterbalancing the skill gaps in todays connected world."}
