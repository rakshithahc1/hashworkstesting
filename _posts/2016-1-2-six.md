The_New_Use_Experience: Grey and tangerine themes have been a legacy and do not get surprised that these themes still are alive to curse the user in spite of technological advances. While most of the large organizations are abandoning the legacy themes and redesigning their product offerings from the scratch.

para:  Grey and tangerine themes have been a legacy and do not get surprised that these themes still are alive to curse the user in spite of technological advances. While most of the large organizations are abandoning the legacy themes and redesigning their product offerings from the scratch, I can only say that a revolution has started – A revolution of CRM (Customer relationship Management) as CX (Customer Experience). 

para4: Imagine a routine service experience – a query regarding a product that was sold to a customer. The company receives millions of such calls on a daily basis and it is the prerogative of the customer support executive to ensure that the calls are handled well. The focus is towards a towering customer satisfaction experience during these interactions with the customer.

para5: Are we serious?<br/>Do we even know if the customers are happy actually?<br/>

para6: While all your data suggests that the customers are happy which are derived out of the moments of engagement with the customer, it may so seem that the customer might have actually been trying to resolve a nagging technical problem.<br/>An organization that manages the complete journey of the customer by putting the customers at the center of their business will not only do its best with the transaction, but will ensure that faster feedback loops are created to address the root causes of the call and continuously improve the interaction experience. In short CX treats the fragmented processes as a single journey. Organizations have started taking advantage of these latest developments to provide valuable experiences for customers and employees.

para7: In our engagement with one of the leading computer technology company, we have been focusing on delivering a strong value proposition in the context of CX (customer experience) in the B2B space. Tailoring experiences across channels is core to our business and CX helps looks at customers more holistically than CRM.<br/><br/>“You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back towards the technology – not the other way around” – Steve Jobs
